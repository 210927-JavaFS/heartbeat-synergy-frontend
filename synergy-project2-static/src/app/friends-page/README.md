    genres - incoming data should be an array holding genres
    favorite artists - incoming data should be an array holding top 5 artists

    can either loop through arrays to populate placeholders or could hard code:
    genre[0] in html, genre[1] in html... b/c there is only 5 genres and 5 
    artists
